			<h2>#SaveTheQuarians #ME:A</h2>

			<p>
			I just feel motivated to write this because at the end of the day I am <strong>huge</strong> Mass Effect fan loved the original trilogy and is one of my all time top three games, and yes I am one of these actually did like Andromeda and actually think at it core is a very good game. I will now do my best attempt to explain why I believe this is the case...
			</p>

			<h3>Characters</h3>
			<p>
			This is a difficult one for me, because at the end of the day I did very much enjoy exploring Andromeda as Pathfinder Ryder. I very much enjoyed my crew mates the likes of Peebee, Vetra, Drack, Liam, Cora (some of the banter in the nomad AWESOME!!!).... At this point I have to be honest the characters I just didn't quite compare to the likes of Garrus, Tali, Liara, Mordin, although they did have three games to develop their respective story arcs. The voice acting for the characters was top notch I think.  Romance wise I personally went for Suvi with my female Ryder, I enjoyed our chats going very philosophical about science and religion, the writing was very good. I just thought the romance was very well handled. I feel the weakest character was the Archon I just never really felt threatened by him and got overall very little screen time and just  lacked the menacing aura that the Reapers had.
			</p>

			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>
			This is a short point but might not go how you think... The fact is I thought the story was good, interesting I enjoyed being a pathfinder exploring the Helios cluster forging a new path for humanity and other milky way races. Meeting the Angara for the first time
			</p>

			<h3>Enivornment</h3>
			<p>
			In one word WOHHH, the variety, the detail of the environments was certainly I feel the best in the franchise. The jungles of Havarl, the Aurora of Veold and New Tuckancha to name but a few. Driving around in the nomad was much <strong>better</strong> and easier then fan favourite Mako!! Also I thought it was very cool how you could fly through the systems and when you arrived at a planet go to your quarters and see the planet!! Speny many a time just admiring the view from my cabin.
			</p>

			<h3>Combat</h3>
			<p>
			This I feel the strongest element overall in the game, it is fast, fluid and very enjoyable. I really enjoyed the way I could swap between my load-outs depending on the situation giving really flexible approach to combat. I loved the way the jump pack added verticality to the combat, loved being able to hover snipe!!!! I liked the weapon and armour upgrade system with the augmentations and mods I could make some truly unique and powerful weaponry. My one and only issue I had was the inability to control directly your teammates abilities an being unable to upgrade their armour and weapons.
			</p>

			<h3>Overall</h3>
			<p>
			To me at the end of day is Mass Effect: Andromeda a good game boils down to one question, did I enjoy myself playing the game? And at the end of the yes I did, so to me it makes a good game. Not perfect, has it flaws but I enjoyed the time I spent with it and I will return to Andromeda again!!! Hopefully with some Quarian SP DLC PLEASSSEEEEEEEE...............
